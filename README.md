# Cloud FinOps Agent Skill

**Give any LLM structured FinOps domain knowledge.** 25 reference files covering cloud cost optimization, AI economics, and the FinOps Foundation framework — installable in one command.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install to your project's .claude/skills/ directory
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suan-digital/cloud-finops-agent-skill/main/install.sh | bash
```

Or manually copy the `cloud-finops/` directory to your `.claude/skills/` folder.

See [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md) for all installation methods (Claude Code, Claude.ai projects, VS Code, API).

## What This Does

Drop this skill into any LLM-powered development environment and it becomes a FinOps advisor that:

1. **Asks before prescribing** — Structured intake protocol gathers context before analysis
2. **Assesses maturity** — Shuhari (守破離) framework goes deeper than Crawl-Walk-Run
3. **Routes by business problem** — "Our AI costs are out of control" triggers different references than "We need a commitment strategy"
4. **Applies 8 analysis dimensions** — From FinOps practice assessment to GreenOps waste remediation
5. **Outputs structured reports** — 9-section template that executives can forward to their CFO
6. **Knows provider specifics** — AWS, Azure, GCP, OCI, plus AI providers and data platforms

## Coverage

### 25 Reference Files

| Category | Files | Topics |
|---|---|---|
| **Methodology** | 6 | Advisory principles, intake protocol, output format, file analysis, adaptation patterns, Suan methodology |
| **Framework** | 3 | Shuhari maturity, architecture-cost alignment, FinOps Foundation (22 capabilities) |
| **AI Economics** | 4 | Hidden 4-5x cost multiplier, inference economics (5-lever playbook), GenAI capacity planning, AI value governance |
| **Operations** | 3 | GreenOps 8-fix playbook, tagging governance, cost visibility tooling |
| **Cloud Providers** | 4 | AWS (100+ patterns), Azure (40+ patterns), GCP (25+ patterns), OCI |
| **AI Providers** | 4 | Anthropic/Claude, AWS Bedrock, Azure OpenAI, Google Vertex AI |
| **Data Platforms** | 2 | Databricks (DBU optimization), Snowflake (credit optimization) |

### 8 Analysis Dimensions

| # | Dimension | Key Question |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | FinOps Practice Assessment | Which of 22 capabilities are gaps? |
| 2 | Phase Positioning | Inform → Optimize → Operate — where stuck? |
| 3 | Maturity Assessment | Shu / Ha / Ri — which stage? |
| 4 | Architecture-Cost Alignment | Is cost a first-class design constraint? |
| 5 | AI Cost Visibility | Is the 4-5x hidden cost known? |
| 6 | Inference Economics | Model routing, caching, attribution? |
| 7 | Waste Remediation | Which GreenOps fixes apply? |
| 8 | Cost Visibility & Tooling | Can anyone query costs conversationally? |

## What Makes This Different

| Dimension | Other FinOps Skills | This Skill |
|---|---|---|
| **Entry point** | Jump to domain reference | Intake protocol — ask first |
| **Routing** | By provider/technology | By business problem first, then provider |
| **Maturity model** | Crawl/Walk/Run | Shuhari 守破離 (philosophical depth) |
| **Cost philosophy** | "Optimize existing spend" | "80% locked at design time — design for cost" |
| **AI costs** | Token pricing only | 4-5x total cost multiplier (hidden costs) |
| **Output** | Unstructured | 9-section report template |
| **File analysis** | None | Terraform, K8s, bills, architecture docs |
| **Adaptation** | One-size-fits-all | By spend tier + AI maturity |

## Sample Prompts

Try these after installation:

- **"Assess our FinOps maturity"** → Triggers intake protocol + Shuhari assessment
- **"Our AWS bill is $80K/month, too high"** → Triggers intake + AWS-specific + architecture-cost analysis
- **"AI inference costs are out of control"** → Triggers intake + inference economics + AI cost visibility
- **"Review this Terraform file for cost issues"** → File analysis protocol
- **"We need a commitment strategy for Azure"** → Azure-specific + finops framework
